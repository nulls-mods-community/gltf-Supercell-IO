        # stripped (so the armature modifier does not deform the mesh at
        # rest), so a naive re-export would write a unit node scale.
        #
        # Restoring the joint's scale is a right-multiply of the bone's
        # vtree ``matrix_world`` by a diagonal scale. Doing only this is

        # when the export pipeline computes the child's local TRS via
        # ``parent.matrix_world.inverted() @ child.matrix_world`` -- the
        # parent's S^-1 multiplies the child's decomposition, which would

        # own hook pass ran first), the rightmost S_ancestor commutes
